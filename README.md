# BigMatrixCylinder

The BigMatrixCylinder is a large LED cylinder with 1680 addressable LEDs (84x20 matrix) showing beautiful animations and allowing up to 4 people playing games like Tetris against each other. In party mode, it shows audio triggered animations and is controlled via ArtNet. It's powered by either a Raspberry Pi, a Teensy 4, a PixelBlaze.

## Custom Animations

Easiest way of preparing custom animations are GIF files or picture slideshows. GIFs can be streched to the matrix size, but best results will be generated with native 21x5 aspect ratio. Currently, GIFs are played with fixed transition time between the frames, but overall speed can be changed.

## Custom Games
coming soon.
